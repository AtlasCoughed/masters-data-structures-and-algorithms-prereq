# MakerSquare Masters Prerequisites

  Prior to entering the MakerSquare Masters program a student should be able to
  implement a linked list, tree, graph, stack, queue, array, basic sorting algorithms
  and a hash table in JavaScript. If a student can answer the following questions then
  they are ready for this program. Once you are ready, schedule an interview slot.

### Linked List
  * Implement a linked list with the methods addElement() and findElement(value).
    The addElement() method adds a node to the tail of a linked list.
    The findElement(value) checks to see if a node with some value is in the linked list.
  * Create a method to find the length of a singly linked list. The length of
    a singly linked list is simply how many nodes it has.
  * Create a method to find the length of a circular linked list.

### Trees
  * What is the worst-case time complexity of depth-first tree search?
  * What’s the difference between breadth first traversal (i.e, pre-order) and
    depth first traversal (i.e., level-order)?
  * Implement a breadth-first filter on a tree class. This method should
    filter out elements in a tree in breadth-first order.

### Graph
  * Can you devise a method on a graph that removes a node?
  * Implement a graph with the methods addNode() and connectNodes().
  * Implement a graph using an adjacency list and another using an adjacency matrix.

### Stack
  * Implement a method that pushes onto a stack.
  * Implement a method that pops off of a stack.
  * Devise a method on a stack called getSize() that computes how many elements are
    currently in the stack.

### Array
  * What is the time complexity for retrieving the value of the nth indexed element in an array?
  * How are the elements in an array typically stored in memory?
  * Suppose you are given a multidimensional array of the form: var multidimensionalArray =
    [ [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [6, 7, 8] ]. How would you access the element with the value 5?
  * What is the average-case time complexity of finding the maximum value in an array of integers?

### Queue
  * Implement a queue.
  * Write a method to enqueue to a queue. Write a method that dequeues.
  * Use a queue to create a breadth-first selection method on a tree.
    This method would traverse a tree in breadth-first  order, filtering out values as it traversed.

### Hash Table
  * What is the time complexity for looking up a value in a hash table?
  * What role does a hash function play in accessing and inserting elements in a hash table?
  * Solve the Two Sum problem using a hash table. The ‘Two Sum’ problem is as follows:  given an
    array of integers, return the largest sum of any two numbers in the input array.
  * What is the main characteristic of a good hash function? *Hint: This characteristic will prevent
    needless collisions in a hash table*.

### Sorting
  * Implement bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort and quick sort.
  * What are the worst-case time complexities of these algorithms?

### Fundamental JavaScript
  * When is a new local scope created in JavaScript?
  * Do you know the difference between the four major object instantiation patterns
    in JavaScript? They are the functional, functional shared, prototypal and pseudoclassical instantiation patterns?
  * How and when does one use the keyword *this*?
  * Know how to use apply, call and bind.

## Resources for Review

  If you need to brush up on any of these topics then we recommend the following preparatory resources:

  1. This [WikiBook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Data_Structures) covers all of the data structures mentioned above.
  2. *Introduction to Algorithms* by Leiserson, Stein, Rivest and Cormen (3rd Edition) is the canonical text on
     algorithms and data structures.
      * This text covers:
        * Linked Lists on pages 236-240
        * Graphs in Chapter 22
        * Stacks on pages 232-234
        * Queues on pages 234-235
        * Hash Tables on pages 256-259 & 262-264
  3. For an accessible introduction to linked lists see [this](http://blog.millermedeiros.com/linked-lists/) blog post.
  4. A introduction to graphs can be found  [here](https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/introduction-to-graphs-and-their-data-structures-section-1/).
  5. For a highly intuitive discussion of sorting algorithms [this](http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/) site is particularly useful.
