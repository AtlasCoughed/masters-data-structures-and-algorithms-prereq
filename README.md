# MakerSquare Masters Prerequisites

Prior to entering the MakerSquare Masters program a student should be able to
implement a linked list, tree, graph, stack, queue, array, basic sorting algorithms
and a hash table in JavaScript. If a student can answer the following questions then
they are ready for this program. Once you are ready, schedule an interview slot.

## Linked List
  * Implement a linked list with the methods addElement() and findElement(value).
    The addElement() method adds a node to the tail of a linked list.
    The findElement(value) checks to see if a node with some value is in the linked list.
  * Create a method to find the length of a singly linked list. The length of
    a singly linked list is simply how many nodes it has. 
  * Create a method to find the length of a circular linked list.
