# MakerSquare Masters Prerequisites

Prior to entering the MakerSquare Masters program a student should be able to
implement a linked list, tree, graph, stack, queue, array, basic sorting algorithms
and a hash table in JavaScript. If a student can answer the following questions then
they are ready for this program. Once you are ready, schedule an interview slot.

### Linked List
* Implement a linked list with the methods addElement() and findElement(value).
    The addElement() method adds a node to the tail of a linked list.
    The findElement(value) checks to see if a node with some value is in the linked list.
* Create a method to find the length of a singly linked list. The length of
    a singly linked list is simply how many nodes it has.
  * Create a method to find the length of a circular linked list.

### Trees
  * What is the worst-case time complexity of depth-first tree search?
  * Whatâ€™s the difference between breadth first traversal (i.e, pre-order) and
    depth first traversal (i.e., level-order)?
  * Implement a breadth-first filter on a tree class. This method should
    filter out elements in a tree in breadth-first order.

### Graph
* Can you devise a method on a graph that removes a node?
* Implement a graph with the methods addNode() and connectNodes().
* Implement a graph using an adjacency list and another using an adjacency matrix.


### Stack
* Implement a method that pushes onto a stack.
* Implement a method that pops off of a stack.
* Devise a method on a stack called getSize() that computes how many elements are
  currently in the stack.



### Array

### Queue

### Hash Table
